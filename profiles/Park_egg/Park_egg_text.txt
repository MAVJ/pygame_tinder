I'm someone simple with simple intentions... But o-of c-course you're n-not simple! I was just saying..
I enjoy to see the ducks swimming in line across the lake, so cute and dumb. Shh, that's my secret
The only thing better than being in nature is to have se...vere discussions about global warming, hehe
